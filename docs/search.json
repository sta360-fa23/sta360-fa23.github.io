Course topics include Bayes’ theorem, exchangeability, conjugate priors, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approximation, Gibbs sampling, hierarchical modeling, Bayesian regression and generalized linear models. We compare and contrast Bayesian methods to the frequentist paradigm. By the end of this course students should feel comfortable (1) writing Bayesian models and, when appropriate, (2) sampling from the posterior using MCMC to make inference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\nOffice hours\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nDr. Alexander Fisher\naaf29@duke.edu\nTu: 11:30pm-1:30pm\nOld Chem 207\n\n\nCarol Wang\nzhuoqun.wang@duke.edu\nMo: 6:00pm-8:00pm\nZoom\n\n\nManny Mokel\nemmanuel.mokel@duke.edu\nTh: 3:00pm-5:00pm\nOld Chem 203B\n\n\nCaitrin Murphy\ncaitrin.murphy@duke.edu\nWe: 4:30pm-6:30pm\nOld Chem 025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture\nTu/Th 10:05 - 11:20am\nOld Chemistry 116\n\n\nLab 01\nM 3:05pm - 4:20pm\nPerkins LINK 087 (Classroom 3)\n\n\nLab 02\nM 4:40pm - 5:55pm\nSocial Sciences 124\n\n\n\nCourse website: sta360-fa23.github.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods.

If you score \\(>60\\%\\) cumulatively on your final quiz grade, you will receive full participation credit. Your lowest two quizzes will also be dropped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on exams\n\n\n\nIf you miss either midterm 1 or midterm 2, and have an excused absence, your missing midterm grade will be replaced by your final exam grade. You must take at least 1 midterm and the final exam to pass the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nBy enrolling in this course, you commit to upholding Duke’s community standard reproduced as follows:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\nAny violations of academic integrity will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action. For the Exams and Quizzes, students are required to work alone. For the Homework assignments, students may work with a study group but each student must write up and submit their own answers.\nLate work\nLate homework may be submitted with 48 hours of the assignment deadline. Late homework submitted within 24 hours (even 1 minute late) will receive a 5% late penalty. Late work submitted between 24 to 48 hours of the deadline will receive a 10% late penalty. Work submitted after 48 hours will not be accepted. Exams cannot be turned in late and can only be excused under exceptional circumstances. The Duke policy for illness requires a short-term illness report or a letter from the Dean; except in emergencies, all other absenteeism must be approved in advance (e.g., an athlete who must miss class may be excused by prior arrangement for specific days). For emergencies, email notification is needed at the first reasonable time.\nErrors in grading\nErrors in grading must be brought to the attention of the TA or instructor during office hours within 1 week of receiving the grade."

For example, one of the rules of algebra is additive association. (x + y) + z == x + (y + z). Check if this is true in R using \\(x = 0.1\\), \\(y = 0.1\\) and \\(z = 1\\). Explain what you find.\n\nAdditional examples of floating point pecularity are provided below.\n\n# example 1\n0.2 == 0.6 / 3\n# example 2\npoint3 <- c(0.3, 0.4 - 0.1, 0.5 - 0.2, 0.6 - 0.3, 0.7 - 0.4)\npoint3\npoint3 == 0.3\n\nTo work around these issues, you could use all.equal() for checking the equality of two double quantities in R. What does all.equal() do?\n\n# example 1, all.equal()\nall.equal(0.2, 0.6 / 3)\n# example 2, all.equal()\npoint3 <- c(0.3, 0.4 - 0.1, 0.5 - 0.2, 0.6 - 0.3, 0.7 - 0.4)\npoint3\nall.equal(point3, rep(.3, length(point3)))\n\n\nWhat do these functions do?\n\nUse ?rnorm to read the documentation and explain the output of each of the following:\n\nrnorm(10, mean = 1, sd = 2)\npnorm(0)\ndnorm(0.5)\nqnorm(0.5)\n\nHow is dnorm(0.5) computed? Can you compute it manually?\n\nShow it numerically\n\n\\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) means that \\(X\\) is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Show, using rnorm that if \\(X \\sim N(0, 1)\\) and \\(Y \\sim N(1, 2)\\) that \\(\\mathbb{E}(X + Y) = 1\\) and \\(\\mathbb{V}(X + Y) = 3\\)\n\n\n\n\nControl flow\n\n\n# for loop example\nfor (i in 1:5) {\n  cat(\"Hello\", i, \"\\n\")\n}\n\n# if else example\nx = 1\nif(x > 0) {\n  print(\"I'm positive x is greater than 0.\")\n} else {\n  print(\"I'm not so positive about x being positive\")\n}\n\nAssume there are 50 days of class. Suppose that, on any given day, there is a \\(X_i\\) probability student \\(i\\) will come to class. Every day you come to class, you obtain Y points towards your final grade. Every day that you don’t come to class, you obtain Z points towards your final grade.\nAssume \\(Y \\sim Uniform(1.9, 2)\\) and \\(Z \\sim Uniform(1, 2)\\).\nAssume student A has a 95% chance of coming to class any given day (X = 0.95) and student B has a 70% of coming to class any given day (X = 0.7). While there are more efficient ways to do this, practice using a for loop, a conditional if statement, rbinom and runif to simulate one possible final grade for each student."

    "text": "Style guidelines\nAlthough coding is not the primary focus of this course, there are a short list below of fundamental principles we will follow. Note: some of these stylistic principles may not be followed in the text!\nFirst, it’s easy to write code that runs off the page when you render to pdf. This happens when you write more than 80 characters in a single line of code. To ensure this doesn’t happen, make sure your code doesn’t have 80 characters in a single line. To enable a vertical line in the RStudio IDE that helps you visually see the limit, go to Tools > Global Options > Code > Display > Show margin > 80. This will enable a vertical line in your .qmd files that shows you where the 80 character cutoff is for code chunks. Instructions may vary slightly for local installs of RStudio.\n\nAll binary operators should be surrounded by space. For example x + y is appropriate. x+y is not.\nAny and all pipes %>% or |> as well as ggplot layers + should be followed by a new line.\nYou should be consistent with stylistic choices, e.g. only use 1 of = vs <- and %>% vs |>\nYour name should be at the top (in the YAML) of each document under “author:”\n\nIf you have any questions about style, please ask a member of the teaching team."
