    "text": "Exercises\nThe following exercises are designed to help you gain basic familiarity with R as well as the quirks of floating point arithmetic.\n\nFloating point algebra.\n\nDo floating point numbers obey the rules of algebra? For example, one of the rules of algebra is additive association. (x + y) + z == x + (y + z). Check if this is true in R using \\(x = 0.1\\), \\(y = 0.1\\) and \\(z = 1\\). Explain what you find.\n\nAdditional examples of floating point pecularity are provided below.\n\n# example 1\n0.2 == 0.6 / 3\n# example 2\npoint3 <- c(0.3, 0.4 - 0.1, 0.5 - 0.2, 0.6 - 0.3, 0.7 - 0.4)\npoint3\npoint3 == 0.3\n\nTo work around these issues, you could use all.equal() for checking the equality of two double quantities in R. What does all.equal() do?\n\n# example 1, all.equal()\nall.equal(0.2, 0.6 / 3)\n# example 2, all.equal()\npoint3 <- c(0.3, 0.4 - 0.1, 0.5 - 0.2, 0.6 - 0.3, 0.7 - 0.4)\npoint3\nall.equal(point3, rep(.3, length(point3)))\n\n\nWhat do these functions do?\n\nUse ?rnorm to read the documentation and explain the output of each of the following:\n\nrnorm(10, mean = 1, sd = 2)\npnorm(0)\ndnorm(0.5)\nqnorm(0.5)\n\nHow is dnorm(0.5) computed? Can you compute it manually?\n\nShow it numerically\n\n\\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) means that \\(X\\) is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Show, using rnorm that if \\(X \\sim N(0, 1)\\) and \\(Y \\sim N(1, 2)\\) that \\(\\mathbb{E}(X + Y) = 1\\) and \\(\\mathbb{V}(X + Y) = 3\\)\n\n\n\n\nControl flow\n\n\n# for loop example\nfor (i in 1:5) {\n  cat(\"Hello\", i, \"\\n\")\n}\n\n# if else example\nx = 1\nif(x > 0) {\n  print(\"I'm positive x is greater than 0.\")\n} else {\n  print(\"I'm not so positive about x being positive\")\n}\n\nAssume there are 50 days of class. Suppose that, on any given day, there is a \\(X_i\\) probability student \\(i\\) will come to class. Every day you come to class, you obtain Y points towards your final grade. Every day that you don’t come to class, you obtain Z points towards your final grade.\nAssume \\(Y \\sim Uniform(1.9, 2)\\) and \\(Z \\sim Uniform(1, 2)\\).\nAssume student A has a 95% chance of coming to class any given day (X = 0.95) and student B has a 70% of coming to class any given day (X = 0.7). While there are more efficient ways to do this, practice using a for loop, a conditional if statement, rbinom and runif to simulate one possible final grade for each student."

    "text": "Style guidelines\nAlthough coding is not the primary focus of this course, there are a short list below of fundamental principles we will follow. Note: some of these stylistic principles may not be followed in the text!\nFirst, it’s easy to write code that runs off the page when you render to pdf. This happens when you write more than 80 characters in a single line of code. To ensure this doesn’t happen, make sure your code doesn’t have 80 characters in a single line. To enable a vertical line in the RStudio IDE that helps you visually see the limit, go to Tools > Global Options > Code > Display > Show margin > 80. This will enable a vertical line in your .qmd files that shows you where the 80 character cutoff is for code chunks. Instructions may vary slightly for local installs of RStudio.\n\nAll binary operators should be surrounded by space. For example x + y is appropriate. x+y is not.\nAny and all pipes %>% or |> as well as ggplot layers + should be followed by a new line.\nYou should be consistent with stylistic choices, e.g. only use 1 of = vs <- and %>% vs |>\nYour name should be at the top (in the YAML) of each document under “author:”\n\nIf you have any questions about style, please ask a member of the teaching team."

Let \\(Y_i\\) be the number of birds counted by individual \\(i\\), and let \\(x_i\\) be the number of hours spent in the forest by volunteer \\(i\\). We will model the data \\(Y_1, \\ldots Y_n\\) as being independent given \\(\\theta\\), but not identically distributed. Specifically, our model is that \\(Y_i | \\theta \\sim \\text{Pois}(\\theta x_i)\\), independently for \\(i = 1, \\ldots n\\).\n\nCompute \\(E~Y_i | \\theta\\) and explain what \\(\\theta\\) represents.\nWrite out a formula for the joint pdf \\(p(y_1, \\ldots y_n |\\theta)\\) and simplify as much as possible. Find the MLE, that is, the value of \\(\\theta\\) that maximizes \\(p(y_1, \\ldots y_n | \\theta)\\). Explain why it makes sense.\nLet \\(\\theta \\sim \\text{gamma}(a, b)\\). Find a formula for the posterior mode of \\(\\theta\\) and compare to the MLE."

    "text": "Exercise 3\nLet \\(\\theta_1\\) be the prevalence of a rare allele among people with Alzheimer’s disease, and let \\(\\theta_2\\) be the prevalence among people without the disease. To estimate \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\), a sample of \\(n_1 = 19\\) Alzheimer’s patients and \\(n_2 = 176\\) control subjects are genotyped for the presence of the allele. Let \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) be the number of people in the two samples who have the allele. We will model \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) as independent with \\(Y_1 | \\theta_1 \\sim \\text{binomial}(n_1, \\theta_1)\\) and \\(Y_2 | \\theta_2 \\sim \\text{binomial}(n_2, \\theta_2)\\). Prior studies suggest that \\(\\theta_2 \\sim \\text{beta}(2, 30)\\) is a reasonable prior distribution for \\(\\theta_2\\). For now, we will use the same prior distribution for \\(\\theta_1\\). The study is performed and the data are that \\(Y_1 = 1\\) and \\(Y_2 = 16\\).\n\nState the posterior distributions of \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\). Plot the posterior densities together on a single graph with the prior density, and compare all three curves with words.\nCompute the posterior mean and a 95% posterior interval for each of \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\).\nWith a picture, with words, or mathematically, try to describe different kind of joint prior distribution for \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) that represents the \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are close to each other, but highly uncertain."
