For example, one of the rules of algebra is additive association. (x + y) + z == x + (y + z). Check if this is true in R using \\(x = 0.1\\), \\(y = 0.1\\) and \\(z = 1\\). Explain what you find.\n\nAdditional examples of floating point pecularity are provided below.\n\n# example 1\n0.2 == 0.6 / 3\n# example 2\npoint3 <- c(0.3, 0.4 - 0.1, 0.5 - 0.2, 0.6 - 0.3, 0.7 - 0.4)\npoint3\npoint3 == 0.3\n\nTo work around these issues, you could use all.equal() for checking the equality of two double quantities in R. What does all.equal() do?\n\n# example 1, all.equal()\nall.equal(0.2, 0.6 / 3)\n# example 2, all.equal()\npoint3 <- c(0.3, 0.4 - 0.1, 0.5 - 0.2, 0.6 - 0.3, 0.7 - 0.4)\npoint3\nall.equal(point3, rep(.3, length(point3)))\n\n\nWhat do these functions do?\n\nUse ?rnorm to read the documentation and explain the output of each of the following:\n\nrnorm(10, mean = 1, sd = 2)\npnorm(0)\ndnorm(0.5)\nqnorm(0.5)\n\nHow is dnorm(0.5) computed? Can you compute it manually?\n\nShow it numerically\n\n\\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) means that \\(X\\) is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Show, using rnorm that if \\(X \\sim N(0, 1)\\) and \\(Y \\sim N(1, 2)\\) that \\(\\mathbb{E}(X + Y) = 1\\) and \\(\\mathbb{V}(X + Y) = 3\\)\n\n\n\n\nControl flow\n\n\n# for loop example\nfor (i in 1:5) {\n  cat(\"Hello\", i, \"\\n\")\n}\n\n# if else example\nx = 1\nif(x > 0) {\n  print(\"I'm positive x is greater than 0.\")\n} else {\n  print(\"I'm not so positive about x being positive\")\n}\n\nAssume there are 50 days of class. Suppose that, on any given day, there is a \\(X_i\\) probability student \\(i\\) will come to class. Every day you come to class, you obtain Y points towards your final grade. Every day that you don’t come to class, you obtain Z points towards your final grade.\nAssume \\(Y \\sim Uniform(1.9, 2)\\) and \\(Z \\sim Uniform(1, 2)\\).\nAssume student A has a 95% chance of coming to class any given day (X = 0.95) and student B has a 70% of coming to class any given day (X = 0.7). While there are more efficient ways to do this, practice using a for loop, a conditional if statement, rbinom and runif to simulate one possible final grade for each student."

    "text": "Style guidelines\nAlthough coding is not the primary focus of this course, there are a short list below of fundamental principles we will follow. Note: some of these stylistic principles may not be followed in the text!\nFirst, it’s easy to write code that runs off the page when you render to pdf. This happens when you write more than 80 characters in a single line of code. To ensure this doesn’t happen, make sure your code doesn’t have 80 characters in a single line. To enable a vertical line in the RStudio IDE that helps you visually see the limit, go to Tools > Global Options > Code > Display > Show margin > 80. This will enable a vertical line in your .qmd files that shows you where the 80 character cutoff is for code chunks. Instructions may vary slightly for local installs of RStudio.\n\nAll binary operators should be surrounded by space. For example x + y is appropriate. x+y is not.\nAny and all pipes %>% or |> as well as ggplot layers + should be followed by a new line.\nYou should be consistent with stylistic choices, e.g. only use 1 of = vs <- and %>% vs |>\nYour name should be at the top (in the YAML) of each document under “author:”\n\nIf you have any questions about style, please ask a member of the teaching team."

Below, we will work to find a class of conjugate priors over \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nWe can break up the joint posterior into two pieces from the axioms of probability:\n\\[\np(\\theta, \\sigma^2 | y_1, \\ldots y_n) = p(\\theta | \\sigma^2, y_1, \\ldots, y_n)p(\\sigma^2|y_1, \\ldots y_n)\n\\]\nThis suggests that we calculate the joint posterior by:\n\nfirst finding the full conditional of \\(\\theta\\): \\(p(\\theta| \\sigma^2, \\vec{y})\\)\nand then finding the marginal posterior of \\(\\sigma^2\\): \\(p(\\sigma^2 | \\vec{y})\\),\n\nwhere \\(\\vec{y} = \\{y_1, \\ldots y_n\\}\\).\n\nThe full conditional of \\(\\theta\\)\nBy Bayes’ theorem,\n\\[\np(\\theta| \\sigma^2, \\vec{y}) \\propto \\underbrace{p(\\vec{y} |\\theta, \\sigma^2)}_{\\text{likelihood}} \\underbrace{p(\\theta|\\sigma^2)}_{\\text{prior}}.\n\\]\nTo arrive at the full conditional posterior of \\(\\theta\\), we must first specify a prior on \\(\\theta\\).\nConsidering we have a normal likelihood, what is a conjugate class of densities for \\(\\theta\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nanswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\theta | \\sigma^2 \\sim N(\\mu_0, \\tau_0^2)\\) for some \\(\\mu_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\tau_0^2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^+\\) is conjugate.\n\n\n\nWith the conjugate prior, our full conditional posterior \\(\\{ \\theta| \\sigma^2, \\vec{y} \\} \\sim N(\\mu_n, \\tau_n^2)\\) where\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu_n &=\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{\\tau_0^2}\\mu_0 + \\frac{n}{\\sigma^2} \\bar{y}}{\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_0^2} + \\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}\n}\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\tau_n^2 &= \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\tau_0^2} + \\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nLet’s sketch out ‘completing the square’ to derive the parameters offline.\n\n\n\nIntuitive posterior parameters\nIf we consider the posterior precision, \\(\\frac{1}{\\tau_n^2}\\), we can re-arrange the terms above to illuminate how posterior information = prior information + data information;.\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_n^2}= \\frac{1}{\\tau_0^2} + \\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}\n\\]\nIn words, posterior precision is equivalent to prior precision plus sampling precision. If we name each precision term, \\(\\lambda_0 = \\frac{1}{\\tau_0}\\), \\(\\lambda_n = \\frac{1}{\\tau_n}\\) and \\(\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\) then\n\\[\n\\mu_n = \\frac{\\lambda_0^2}{\\lambda_0^2 + n\\lambda^2} \\mu_0 +\n\\frac{n\\lambda^2}{\\lambda_0^2 + n\\lambda^2} \\bar{y}\n\\]\ni.e. the posterior mean is the weighted average of prior and sample mean, where the weights are the relative contribution of each precision!\nWe can re-define \\(\\lambda_0^2 = \\kappa_0 \\lambda^2\\) (or equivalently \\(\\tau_0^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\kappa_0}\\)) and obtain\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu_n &= \\frac{\\kappa_0}{\\kappa_0 + n} \\mu_0 + \\frac{n}{\\kappa_0 + n} \\bar{y},\\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_n^2} &= \\frac{\\kappa_0 + n}{\\sigma^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere we can interpret \\(\\kappa_0\\) as the prior sample size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote that \\(\\tau_n^2\\) is the posterior variance of the full conditional posterior of \\(\\theta\\). This is distinct from \\(\\sigma_n^2\\), defined below.\n\n\n\n\nPrior on \\(\\sigma^2\\)\nRemember, we want \\(p(\\theta, \\sigma^2 | \\vec{y}) = p(\\theta | \\sigma^2, y_1, \\ldots, y_n)p(\\sigma^2|y_1, \\ldots y_n)\\). We have the first component of the right hand side, what about the second component?\nNotice that\n\\[\np(\\sigma^2 | \\vec{y}) \\propto p(\\sigma^2)\\int p(\\vec{y} | \\theta, \\sigma^2) p(\\theta|\\sigma^2) d\\theta\n\\]\nBut how do we choose \\(p(\\sigma^2)\\) to be conjugate? We can proceed in multiple ways: one is noting that the integral is really a convolution of normals, (thereby a sum of normals) and is therefore a normal density.\nUpon inspection, we can see a suitable choice is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sim \\text{gamma}(a, b)\\).\n\n\nThe inverse-gamma\nA random variable \\(X \\in (0, \\infty)\\) has an inverse-gamma(a,b) distribution if \\(\\frac{1}{X}\\) has a gamma(a,b) distribution.\nIf X has an inverse-gamma distribution, the density of X is\n\\[\np(x | a, b) = \\frac{b^a}{\\Gamma(a)} x^{-a-1}e^{-b/x} \\ \\text{for } \\ x > 0\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nEX &= \\frac{b}{(a-1)} \\text{ if } a \\geq 1; \\ \\infty \\text{ if } 0<a<1,\\\\\nVar(X) &= \\frac{b^2}{(a-1)^2(a-2)} \\ \\text{if } a \\geq 2; \\ \\infty \\text{ if } 0 < a < 2,\\\\\nMode(X) &= \\frac{b}{a +1}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nThe marginal posterior of \\(\\sigma^2\\)\nTaken all together, if we let our sampling model and prior distributions be such that\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_i | \\theta, \\sigma^2 &\\sim N(\\theta, \\sigma^2)\\\\\n\\theta | \\sigma^2 & \\sim N(\\mu_0, \\sigma^2/\\kappa_0)\\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} &\\sim \\text{gamma}(\\frac{\\nu_0}{2}, \\frac{\\nu_0}{2} \\sigma_0^2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nthen the posterior\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} | \\vec{y} \\sim \\text{gamma}(\\frac{\\nu_n}{2}, \\frac{\\nu_n \\sigma^2_n}{2}),\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nu_n &= \\nu_0 + n,\\\\\n\\sigma^2_n &= \\frac{1}{\\nu_n} \\left[\n\\nu_0 \\sigma^2_0 +(n-1)s^2 + \\frac{\\kappa_0 n}{\\kappa_0 + n}(\\bar{y} - \\mu_0)^2\n\\right],\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand \\(s^2\\) is the sample variance, \\(\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_i (y_i - \\bar{y})^2\\)."
