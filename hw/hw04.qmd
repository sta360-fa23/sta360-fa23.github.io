## Exercise 1

Let 

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y | \theta, \sigma^2 &\sim N(\theta, \gamma)\\
\theta | \sigma^2 &\sim N(\mu_0, 1/\gamma \kappa_0)\\
\gamma &\sim \text{gamma}(a, b)
\end{aligned}
$$
so $\gamma$ is the precision (inverse-variance) of the normal distribution.

a. Derive and simplify the joint pdf $p(y_1, \ldots y_n | \theta, \sigma^2)$

b. Derive the posterior of the *precision*, $p(\frac{1}{\sigma^2}| y_1, \ldots y_n)$. Hint: the problem is discussed on page 75 of the book.

c. Derive the posterior of $\theta$, $p(\theta | y_1, \ldots y_n)$


## Exercise 2

Exercise 5.1 from Hoff. You can read in the data from the three schools with the R code below. Hint: the problem specification is just like in exercise 1, except $a = \nu_0/2$ and $b = \nu_0 \sigma_0^2/2$.

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
school1 = read_csv("https://sta360-fa23.github.io/data/school1.csv")
school2 = read_csv("https://sta360-fa23.github.io/data/school2.csv")
school3 = read_csv("https://sta360-fa23.github.io/data/school3.csv")
```
